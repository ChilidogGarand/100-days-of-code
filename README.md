# 100 Days of Python Challenge

So challenged by some of my fellow data center server monkeys, I'm pledging to stick to 100 days of learning Python. Find my pledge below. I'll also be uploading all notes I take in `notes.md`.

*I, Chilidog Garand (first of his name) am commited to completing the 100 Days of Python challenge. I hereby pledge to work for at least an hour on Python programming for 100 days. I will keep myself on track, even though some days I might feel tired or frustrated. I will keep myself accountable, even though I have lots of things to do, I will make this a priority in my life. I will overcome difficulties to achieve my goal. I will become a Python developer. I believe in myself.*

*Signed: Chilidog Garand (First of his Name)*
*On this, the Seventeenth Day of September, Two Thousand and Twenty Two*
*"Videte ne turbemini."*
